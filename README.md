## Description
This repo contains code of a custom [Google Data Studio connector](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector/gallery/) for displaying stats about your recent plays in Spotify. 

The connector uses [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/player/get-recently-played/) to fetch the tracks.
Unfortunately the API endpoint is currently limited to the recent 50 tracks.
